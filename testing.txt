Notes on Firefox:
No checkout link in the nav bar
Dogtile buttons are a little off-center
“see more dogs” also off center
Blog preview pics look a bit stretched
Dogtiles on “dogs” page are not active
Links work beautifully and take you where they say they will take you

Same notes for Edge (couldn’t find the responsive toggle – sorry!)
Same notes for Chrome –
and the “checkout” button tends to float up into cart icon and mobile
size the text evens out (balances out with images and looks good) iPad size
on index page there’s a bit large white space in the lower right hand corner


Phone size: too much text between pics on blog page, index looks (singular tiles are perfect),
but the nav breaks (links go all over the place) and there ends up being too much text between pics


Overall improvements to be made in MVP2 to ensure site quality:

- make nav bar collapse on mobile viewport
- review breakpoint on nav to fix issue of links going in multiple places
- better spacing for dog tiles on mobile --- make sure it does not take up 100%
- validate JS working on both index.html and dog pageß
