Persona for the Adopt Dog website:
Most of my site users access my website via mobile as well as tablets and they are between 25 to 60 years old. From these users, I picked one 60 years old user as a sample and his preference to access my website.
Name: Tom Jones
Education: High school diploma
Age: 60
Occupation: Private investigator
Activities: Travelling, volunteering in private investigation
Owns: 6-month-old Smartphone, one-year old tablet and 2-year old computer
To accomplish his investigation job, Tom is looking for to adopt a dog.  He is working in collaborating with the government agencies so that he wants to show the available dogs from my site to get a fund. His agency does not use computer to view the dogs so that his first question was if the site supported in mobile and tablets. The good thing is the site is fully responsive in mobile phones and tablets.
