Testing

This site was tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox with much success. One minor note- on an older version of Chrome on an older iMac, there were some alignment issues with the cart icon/cost features in the header. This was solved by tweaking the flexbox code for those two elements (added align-items: baseline)

The site features well on iPhone and iPad, with the media queries operating successfully, creating a positive UX for each platform.

The site also features well across different platforms (Mac and PC).
