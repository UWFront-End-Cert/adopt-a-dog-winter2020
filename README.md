# Adopt-a-dog Website

## Background

This repository contains source files for cyyllam.github.io/adopt-a-dog-winter2020, one of the course projects for HTML5 200 winter quarter 2020 of the University of Washington's Certificate in Front-End Development program. 

The fictional Adopt-a-dog website is written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript with some instances of JQuery. The purpose of the site was to build on top of the skills learned in HTML5 100 (Intro to HTML & CSS) and incorporate items from lessons relating to:

* JavaScript basics 
* media queries
* DOM interaction with JavaScript
* Introduction to JQuery

## Using the site

This site is best run on Chrome. Media queries allow it to be displayed formidably on tablet and smaller mobile devices though checkout content is excluded on small devices.

Users of the site can click on links and be directed to its expected page. Users can also click on 'Adopt' buttons and view a running total in the upper right hand checkout corner. Images of dogs can be clicked and an alert will display.

### Issues

While there are no bugs per se that will crash the site, there are areas where functionalities does not exist where expected. Here are a few of them:

* running total in upper right checkout corner does not persist across pages and will revert to $0.00
* 'Adopted' dogs are not tracked and does not appear in the Checkout form
