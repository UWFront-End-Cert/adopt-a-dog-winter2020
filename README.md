Adopt-A-Dog seeks to find wonderful, loving homes for dogs in animal shelters all over King County. Through the site, users can shop for the dogs they want and fill out an order/delivery form to complete the process. Users, especially first-time adopters, can also read a dog blog to get tips on how to interact with their dogs. 

This is not a bonafide website and is merely a mockup that was created for a certificate program through the University of Washington for Front-End Development. The course taught basic JS principles and built on the previous HTML/CSS course by also teaching how to make websites responsive to all devices. The Adopt-A-Dog website was used to put what we learned into practice. 

Requirements:
The website works best on newer versions of browsers but can generally handle Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Safari and Samsung Internet. It should be viewable on all devices from a large desktop to the size of an iPhone5. 

Dev Notes:
There are four html pages: index, dogs, blog and contact.

There are two different JS files: one is for the site as a whole (script.js). There is also a separate one for the blog page  since we tried to make that by calling elements as objects from the DOM. 

There is a CSS file to handle all the styling of the website. The folder that contains this also contains the header images.

The comps files contains the mockup versions of the site we could create (one with/without a background image in the header).

Design Notes
As mentioned before, this is a mockup and, therefore, was not designed by me.
