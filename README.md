Testing 
In order to test my Adopt Dog website browser support, in desktop I used the following browsers:
1. Google chrome
2. Firefox 
3. Safari
In Mobile, I tested on:
1. Safari for iOS and 
2. Chrome for Android 

Covered tests: By using these browsers I tested the following 
* If the text, buttons and images are aligned properly when changing the device size and orientation
* If the buttons are clickable and the hover effect is also working properly
* If the paddings are consistent to all the pages 
* I also validated my code in HTML validator to increase the readability of the code

Not covered tests: 
* Testing using screen readers 
* Testing for the color-blind users
* Testing in Opera browser
