# Adopt-a-dog
**Taylor Sommers**

### Description
The adopt-a-dog site is most compatible on Chrome, but works well in FireFox and Edge. It is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
and hosted on GitHub pages. Adopt-a-dog is ipad and mobile compatible.


- Current state allows users to browse dogs, click on their images to learn more about them, and add their totals to know how much they would spending if they adopted multiple dogs.
- Future state is to allow users to view dogs, add them to their cart, and purchase all within the same site.
