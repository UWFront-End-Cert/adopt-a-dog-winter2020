Adopt A Dog website is for educational purposes only.
If you attempt to actually adopt a dog using Lucas Cheadle's Adopt A Dog website you will be sorely disappointed. What might please you is to know the the creator of this website learned how to build it from scratch through the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education program. As you can see the UWPCE Front-End Web Dev Certificate is doing a fine job teaching folks how to get around in the website design world.
Cheers to UWPCE and James Norton!
